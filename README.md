## Game Description  
**Dungeon Reaper** is a 3D first-person shooter developed in **Unity**, inspired by classic titles like *Doom*.  

In this fast-paced, action-packed game, players take on the role of a lost space marine who, after an unfortunate teleportation mishap, finds himself trapped in a dark and ominous dungeon. His mission: to escape and find a way back home.  

Players will face off against terrifying, magic-wielding monsters as they navigate through the dungeon. Along the way, they can collect weapons, pickups, and other resources to aid in their survival. The protagonist is highly agile, capable of dashing and double-jumping to outmaneuver enemies and evade danger.  

Each level offers intense combat challenges, fast-paced movement, and a deep, immersive atmosphere inspired by retro FPS games.

## My Contributions  
I worked on most aspects of the game, with the exception of the external assets (models, animations, sounds, and music):
- **Gameplay and logic:** character movement (dash, double jump, shooting mechanics), combat system, enemy interactions, weapon mechanics, pickups, and health/damage systems.  
- **Enemy AI:** enemy state machine, enemy behaviors, attacks, movement patterns, and reactions to player actions.  
- **Effects and animations:** combat effects, environmental effects, lighting, and VFX integration.  
- **System integration:** merging gameplay logic with models, animations, and effects to create a seamless, immersive experience.
